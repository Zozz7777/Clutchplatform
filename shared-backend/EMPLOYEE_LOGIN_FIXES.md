# Employee Login Endpoint Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. JWT Token Generation Issue
**Problem**: The `generateJWTToken` method returns an object `{ success: true, data: token }` but the code was trying to use it directly as a string.

**Fix**: Updated the employee-login endpoint to properly handle the token generation response:
```javascript
// Before
const token = employeeAuthService.generateJWTToken(employee._id, permissions.data);

// After
const tokenResult = employeeAuthService.generateJWTToken(employee._id, permissions.data);
if (!tokenResult.success) {
    return res.status(500).json({
        success: false,
        error: 'TOKEN_GENERATION_FAILED',
        message: 'Failed to generate authentication token'
    });
}
const token = tokenResult.data;
```

### 2. Department Reference Issue
**Problem**: The Employee model expects the department field to be an ObjectId reference to a Department model, but the create-employee endpoint was receiving department names as strings.

**Fix**: Updated the create-employee endpoint to:
- Find existing departments by name (case-insensitive)
- Create new departments if they don't exist
- Use the department ObjectId in the employee record

```javascript
// Handle department - create if it doesn't exist
let departmentId = null;
if (req.body.department) {
    const Department = require('../models/Department');
    
    // Try to find existing department by name
    let department = await Department.findOne({ 
        name: { $regex: new RegExp(`^${req.body.department}$`, 'i') } 
    });
    
    if (!department) {
        // Create new department
        department = new Department({
            name: req.body.department,
            code: req.body.department.toUpperCase().substring(0, 3),
            description: `${req.body.department} Department`,
            status: 'active'
        });
        await department.save();
    }
    
    departmentId = department._id;
}
```

### 3. Department Population Issue
**Problem**: The employee-login response wasn't properly populating department information.

**Fix**: Updated the employee query to populate department information:
```javascript
// Populate department information
const Employee = require('../models/Employee');
const employee = await Employee.findById(employeeResult.data._id)
    .populate('employment.department', 'name code')
    .exec();
```

Also updated the `findEmployeeByEmail` method in `employeeAuthService.js`:
```javascript
const employee = await Employee.findOne({ 'basicInfo.email': email.toLowerCase() })
    .populate('employment.department', 'name code');
```

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling and Logging
**Added**: Comprehensive logging and error handling to help debug issues:
- Input validation for email and password
- Detailed logging at each step of the login process
- Better error messages for different failure scenarios

### 5. Improved Response Structure
**Enhanced**: The login response now includes:
- Department information (ID, name, code)
- Better structured user data
- More comprehensive error handling

## Files Modified

1. **`routes/auth.js`**
   - Fixed JWT token generation handling
   - Added department creation/lookup logic
   - Enhanced error handling and logging
   - Improved response structure

2. **`services/employeeAuthService.js`**
   - Updated `findEmployeeByEmail` to populate department information

## Testing

Created a test script `test-employee-login.js` to verify the fixes work correctly.

## Expected Behavior

The employee-login endpoint should now:
1. Properly validate input credentials
2. Find employees by email with populated department information
3. Verify passwords correctly
4. Generate JWT tokens properly
5. Return comprehensive user data including department information
6. Handle department creation automatically when needed

## API Response Format
