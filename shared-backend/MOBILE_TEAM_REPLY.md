## üîó Firebase Integration Acknowledgment

We've noted your current infrastructure leveraging:
- ‚úÖ **Firebase Storage** for file upload/download
- ‚úÖ **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** for push notifications
- ‚úÖ **Firebase SMS** for text messaging
- ‚úÖ **MongoDB Atlas** as the database
- ‚úÖ **Render.com** for backend hosting

The newly implemented backend services are designed to complement this infrastructure. Our new endpoints provide core functionality while integrating seamlessly with your existing Firebase services:

- **Notifications:** Our endpoints manage preferences and history, while FCM handles actual push delivery
- **Documents:** Our insurance and ecommerce modules store references to documents managed in Firebase Storage
- **SMS:** Our endpoints can trigger SMS through your existing Firebase SMS integration

## üìö Documentation

A comprehensive `MISSING_BACKEND_APIS_COMPLETE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` document has been created in the `shared-backend` directory, detailing:
- Complete API reference with endpoints and parameters
- Database schemas and relationships
- Integration guidelines and examples
- Authentication requirements
- Error handling patterns

## üöÄ Next Steps for Mobile App Integration

1. **Review Documentation:** Please refer to `shared-backend/MISSING_BACKEND_APIS_COMPLETE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` for complete API reference
2. **Integration Testing:** Start testing these new endpoints with your mobile apps
3. **Firebase Integration:** Continue using direct Firebase SDK integrations for file uploads, SMS, and push notifications while utilizing our backend APIs for data management and business logic
