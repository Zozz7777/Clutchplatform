## Clutch Admin Frontend: Enhancements & Improvements

### Implemented Quick Wins

- Accessibility
  - Added global skip link to jump to main content
  - Tagged main content with `id="main-content"` and `role="main"`, focusable via skip link
  - Added `aria-label`, `aria-haspopup`, `aria-expanded`, and `aria-controls` to header controls
  - Added ARIA roles/labels to notifications popup and user menu
  - Improved modal accessibility (role="dialog", `aria-modal`, labeled titles)
- UI Consistency & DX
  - Removed dynamic Tailwind class strings in `ModernButton` to avoid purge issues
  - Centralized gradient variants via a static mapping

### Recommended Next Steps

1) Consolidate UI Kit
   - Deprecate legacy `modal.tsx`, `table.tsx`, `input.tsx` usages in favor of modern variants where feasible
   - Create a `README` in `components/ui` documenting preferred components and usage

2) Design Tokens & Theming
   - Extract brand tokens to a dedicated `tokens.css` and import in `globals.css`
   - Add semantic elevation tokens and spacing scale audit for consistency

3) Accessibility
   - Add keyboard trap and focus return to custom modals (modern modal)
   - Ensure all interactive elements have visible focus and proper roles
   - Add form field `aria-describedby` for error/help text in inputs

4) Performance
   - Lazy-load heavy pages and charts via Next dynamic imports with suspense fallbacks
   - Consider list virtualization for large tables

5) Testing & Documentation
   - Add Storybook for `ui` components with accessibility add-on
   - Add smoke tests for layouts and permissions gating

6) Navigation & Information Architecture
   - Persist expanded sub-nav state per section (URL/query or store)
   - Add breadcrumb component across feature pages

7) Content & Empty States
   - Replace placeholder copy with consistent tone
   - Provide actionable empty/error states (CTA, help links)

### Notes

Logos verified in `public` and mapped: uses `Logo Red/White` assets. Consider switching header images to `next/image` for responsive and automatic optimization where possible.
